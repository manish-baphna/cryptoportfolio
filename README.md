# cryptoportfolio
Given set of crypto positions, calculate value of portfolio using latest crypto prices.
I wrote this program as I was missing this feature in Coinbase account. I had many trades
done with Coinbase however it didn't provide a simple view where I can compare how 
much I had invested, what's the latest valuation and my profit and loss status.
